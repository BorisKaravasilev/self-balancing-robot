## Introduction

In the second year of my master's degree, I took the specialization course "Advanced Robotics". In this course, me and my two friends built a self-balancing robot. We implemented and calibrated a PID controller on an Arduino. We also designed the entire body of the robot in Fusion 360 and used a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting to manufacture the robot. We tested the robot in various conditions and documented the results in a report.
