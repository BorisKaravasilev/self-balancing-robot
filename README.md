## Introduction

A self-balancing robot is a robot which has an unstable equilibrium and works as an inverted pendulum, which has its center of mass placed above its pivot point. Such a robot must actively correct itself if it is not to fall over. During this project we designed, assembled and tested such robot and the result is described in our report.
