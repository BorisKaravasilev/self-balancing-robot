## Introduction

During my master's degree in the summer of 2022, I took the most fun course of my life called "How to Make (almost) Anything". I loved it because it was cross-disciplinary and combined software with hardware. In this course, me and my two friends built a self-balancing robot. We implemented and calibrated a PID controller on an Arduino. We also designed the entire body of the robot in Fusion 360 and used a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting to manufacture the robot. We tested the robot in various conditions and documented the results in a report.
